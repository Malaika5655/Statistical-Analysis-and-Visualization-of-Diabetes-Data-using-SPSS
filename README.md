# Statistical Analysis of Diabetic vs Non-Diabetic Datasets

This project explores diabetic and non-diabetic datasets to understand health indicators and their relationships using **SPSS** and **GraphPad**.


## Key Features

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

* Calculated **minimum, maximum, mean, and standard deviation** for:

  * Age
  * Blood Pressure
  * Cholesterol
  * Glucose
  * BMI
* Summarized trends and variability for diabetic vs non-diabetic groups.

### 2. Normality Tests

* Applied **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)** and **Shapiro-Wilk (SW)** tests.
* Determined which variables are normally distributed and suitable for parametric tests.

### 3. Graphical Representations

* **Pie Charts:** Gender distribution, age categories.
* **Histograms:** Age, Blood Pressure, Glucose, Cholesterol, BMI.
* **Box Plots:** Comparison of variables across genders.

### 4. Measures of Central Tendency

* Mean, median, min, and max values calculated for each group.
* Highlighted differences between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

### 5. Correlation Analysis

* Explored relationships among Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose, BMI, Gender, Physical Activity, and Family History.
* Created a **heat map** for visualizing correlation strengths.
* Key findings: Strong positive correlations among Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose, and BMI.

### 6. T-Tests

* Conducted **independent samples t-tests** for gender comparisons.
* Interpreted significant and non-significant differences.

### 7. ANOVA & Multiple Comparisons

* **ANOVA** conducted for variables across three physical activity groups.
* **Tukey HSD** used for post-hoc comparisons.
* Results highlight group differences and trends.

## Insights & Outcomes

* Blood Pressure and Glucose: Normally distributed across genders.
* Cholesterol and BMI: Gender-specific distribution differences.
* Physical Activity and Family History: Non-normal distributions.
* Strong correlations found among Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose, and BMI.
* Provides a comprehensive statistical overview of health indicators in diabetic vs non-diabetic populations.

## Technologies Used

* **SPSS:** Statistical analysis, normality tests, t-tests, ANOVA.
* **GraphPad:** Box plots, segmented plots, visualizations.
